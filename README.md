## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-backend-service.git
    cd secure-backend-service
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

Docker and Kubernetes
Docker
Build and run the Docker container:


docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/secure-backend:latest .
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-dockerhub-username/secure-backend:latest
Kubernetes
Apply the Kubernetes configurations:


kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions. The pipeline performs the following tasks:

Checks out the code
Sets up Python
Installs dependencies
Runs tests
Builds and pushes Docker image
Deploys to Kubernetes
GitHub Actions Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow file .github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml is configured to automate the above tasks on each push to the repository.

Deployment Instructions
Build and push Docker image:


docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/secure-backend:latest .
docker push your-dockerhub-username/secure-backend:latest
Apply Kubernetes configurations:


kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Ensure you have the necessary Kubernetes cluster and access configured for deploying the application.
